# Hostinger Infrastructure Management Microservice

## Introduction

This project is a microservice designed to simplify and secure the management of Hostinger resources such as VPS instances, domains, DNS, billing, and related services.

It introduces a permission-aware access layer that enables multiple teams to safely operate under the same Hostinger account. Access is controlled through clearly defined roles and permissions, allowing individual users to manage only their assigned resources while managers or administrators can oversee the entire infrastructure.

The service is built using Laravel 12 and leverages Spatie Laravel Permissions to enforce role-based and resource-scoped access control.

## Purpose of This Repository

This open-source project is intentionally built as a **study case**.

Its primary goals are to practice and demonstrate:

- Product thinking and system design
- Writing strong foundation and architectural documents
- Defining clear scopes, responsibilities, and boundaries
- Designing permission models and governance structures
- Communicating technical intent effectively
- Developing skills required to grow into a Tech Lead role

The code is important, but the **documentation and decision-making process** are equally central to this project.
